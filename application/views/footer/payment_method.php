PAYMENT METHOD
PayPal allows you to make payments using a variety of methods including: PayPal Balance, bank account, credit card, PayPal Credit, and debit card. Because your protection against undelivered or defective goods will vary with each method, you should review this page to understand how you can select a payment method and how protection differs depending on your payment method.
This page does not address unauthorized transactions. For information on your protection against unauthorized transactions, please see section 12 of the PayPal User Agreement.
Default Payment Methods ***
When you make a payment, if you have not selected a Preferred Payment Method, PayPal will fund your transaction in this order:
· PayPal Balance
· Instant transfer from your bank account (if eligible)
· PayPal Credit (Bill Me Later, PayPal Extras Card, or PayPal Smart Connect)
· Debit card
· Credit card
· eCheck (a delayed transfer from your bank account - may result in significantly slower shipping by seller)
*** Note: If you do not want to use your Balance, you can withdraw it before making a payment.
Preferred Payment Method
You may select a Preferred Payment Method each time you make a payment, except when making a Preapproved Payment, a No Log-In Payment, or an In-Store Checkout payment. Certain Payment Methods may not be available for certain transactions if there are Payment Method limitations, including if you make a PayPal payment through certain third party websites or applications, or if you use PayPal for In-Store Checkout. For a Preapproved Payment or, in most instances, a No Log-In Payment, you can select a Preferred Payment Method when you provide your initial authorization for this payment and through the My Preapproved Payments section of your Account Profile (it may be called "Backup Payment Method"). For In-Store Checkout payments, you may change your Preferred Payment Method in your Account Profile prior to initiating your transaction.
If you select a Preferred Payment Method but have available Balance in your Account, your Balance will be used to fund your payment first. If you set a PayPal Credit product or eCheck as your Preferred Payment Method in your Account Profile, it will be used to fund your PayPal payments first, even if you have a Balance. eCheck is not an available Payment Method for In-Store Checkout.
For Business Payments, you are limited to funding your PayPal payment with either (or both) your Balance or by eCheck.
Changing the Payment Method
You may change the Payment Method at the time you make a payment by clicking the 'More Options'/'Change' link on the Confirm Your Payment/Review Your Information page and then selecting a payment method on the "More Funding Options" page. You may do this each time you make a payment if you do not have a Balance. If you have a Balance, you must use your entire Balance before you can change the payment method.
You cannot select a payment method for all future transactions, except that if you have been approved for PayPal Credit and PayPal Credit is an available Payment Method for the transaction, you may select PayPal Credit as your Preferred Payment Method. You may do so by logging in to your Account, selecting "Profile", selecting your PayPal Credit product, and then setting it as your preferred funding source.
Payment Method Rights and Remedies
PayPal Purchase Protection
PayPal Purchase Protection (also known as PayPal Buyer Protection) applies for certain, qualifying purchases regardless of the payment method. For these qualifying purchases, PayPal will cover you for the full amount of the item plus original shipping costs if you do not receive the item or if you receive an item but it is significantly different than the description the seller provided. To receive reimbursement for items that are significantly not as described, you will be required to return the item to the seller, or in some cases to PayPal, and to pay the return shipping costs. PayPal Purchase Protection is not available for In-Store Checkout transactions.
To be eligible for PayPal Purchase Protection, you must file a Dispute in the PayPal Resolution Center within 45 days of the date you sent the payment, escalate the Dispute to a Claim within 20 days of the date you filed the Dispute, and meet the eligibility criteria in Section 13 of the PayPal User Agreement.
Bill Me Later Protection
BML offers protection against unauthorized transactions and billing errors, including items not received and items received that are significantly not as described. If any of these issues occur, you must file a dispute with BML within 60 days of the date of your first bill on which the issue occurred. You may file a dispute by either of these methods:
· (1) Dispute Form: Complete the form at www.billmelater.com/Docs/disputeform.pdf and mail or fax it to:
· 
· Bill Me Later
· P.O. Box 5018
· Timonium, MD 21094
· Fax: 443-921-1996
· (2) By Letter: Send a letter to the address above and include the following information:
Your name and account number
The dollar amount pertaining to the error / transaction with the issue
A description of the error / transaction with the issue, and an explanation
To learn more about BML protections, please see your Bill Me Later Terms and Conditions.
You may pursue a Dispute/Claim with PayPal, or you may contact Bill Me Later and file a dispute. You may not pursue both at the same time or seek a double recovery. If you have an open Dispute or Claim with PayPal, and also file a dispute with Bill Me Later, PayPal will close your Dispute or Claim, and you will have to rely solely on your rights under your dispute with Bill Me Later.
If you pursue a Claim with PayPal and you do not receive a full recovery, you can then file a dispute with Bill Me Later. If PayPal does not make a final decision on your Claim until after Bill Me Later's deadline for filing a dispute, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the Bill Me Later, PayPal will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller.
Credit Card Protection
Credit card chargeback rights are broader than PayPal's protection programs. Credit card chargebacks may be filed more than 45 days after the payment and may cover unsatisfactory items even if they do not qualify as significantly not as described.
You may pursue a Dispute/Claim with PayPal, or you may contact your credit card company and file a chargeback. You may not pursue both at the same time or seek a double recovery. If you have an open Dispute or Claim with PayPal, and also file a chargeback with your credit card company, PayPal will close your Dispute or Claim, and you will have to rely solely on your chargeback rights.
If you pursue a Claim with PayPal and if you do not receive a full recovery, you can then file a chargeback. If PayPal does not make a final decision on your Claim until after your credit card issuer's deadline for filing a chargeback, and because of our delay you recover less than the full amount you would have been entitled to recover from the credit card issuer, we will reimburse you for the remainder of your loss (minus any amount you have already recovered from the seller).
Credit card companies must abide by these statutory guidelines, including but not limited to the following:
· If a consumer claims a "billing error" because an item is not received or is refused at the time of delivery, the card issuer is obliged to investigate, resolve, and to correct written claims filed by the consumer within 60 days of receipt of the applicable credit card statement.
· If a consumer claims a dispute with a merchant, the card issuer is obliged to investigate and resolve consumer claims, provided the consumer: (i) has not paid for the charge (ii) has made a good faith attempt to settle the dispute with the merchant (iii) lives in the same state as or within 100 miles of the merchant and (iv) paid more than $50 for the item.
You should contact your credit card issuer to learn more about your rights and remedies.
Debit Card Protection
Your debit card issuer is not required by law to provide you with protection against items that you do not receive or that are significantly not as described. Many debit card issuers voluntarily provide protection similar to the chargeback rights provided by credit card issuers.
PayPal may process debit card transactions through either (a) an ATM debit network such as STAR or NYCE, or (b) a Visa or MasterCard network. If we process your debit card through an ATM debit network, we may provide you with the opportunity to switch to a Visa or MasterCard network by clicking the "Funding Sources" link on the payment confirmation page. Choosing the Visa / MasterCard network may give you additional protection compared to the ATM debit networks. You should contact your debit card issuer to learn more about your rights and remedies if you pay with your debit card.
Bank Account Protection
Your bank is not required by law to provide you with protection against items that you pay for with a bank transfer but that you do not receive or that are significantly not as described. You should contact your bank to determine if they voluntarily provide any purchase protection.
