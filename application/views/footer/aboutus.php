The name La Belle Aurore is taken from a French bistro in the 1940's film Casablanca. La Belle Aurore means the beautiful daybreak or the beautiful sunrise. Aurore could also serve as a woman's name, as with Aurora; the beautiful Aurore.

Let's take time and encourage people, especially the youth, to read, not only to be taken as a form of recreation, but also as a privilege to develop reason and inquiry, and habituate our minds to critical thought.
